# Module4-Challenge
this repository is where I'll create a coding quiz for the module 4 challenge.

# Goals
### WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
### WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
### WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
### WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
### WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
